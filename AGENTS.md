# Inspector

iOS process inspector for custom firmware with a roothide or rootless bootstrap: UIKit app (`Inspector/`), XPC daemon (`Inspectord/`), CLI (`InspectorCLI/`), shared wire/data layer (`Shared/`, `InspectorClient/`).

## Build

- `make build` — validates inputs (`check`), runs the macOS data-layer test harness (`harness`), bumps `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` (so `Version.xcconfig` comes out of a build dirty by design), then builds the unsigned iOS app + daemon + CLI via xcodebuild. Requires `xcodebuild`, `ldid`, `dpkg-deb`.
- `make deb` — build + ad-hoc sign + package the `.deb` for `FLAVOR` (default `roothide`; `FLAVOR=rootless` installs under `/var/jb` as `iphoneos-arm64`), verify it with `Scripts/verify-deb.sh`, and print its sha256. Output path: `make print-deb-path [FLAVOR=rootless]`. `make deb-all` builds both.
- Nothing is packaged that cannot launch on the floor. `Scripts/audit-ios-floor.sh` (from the platformize-app-ios template; update it there and copy it verbatim) runs over the built app, daemon and CLI before `package-deb.sh`, and `verify-deb.sh` runs it again over the extracted payload at the package's own `firmware (>= x.y)`, so CI's verify step refuses the same things. It fails on a required library, an embedded build version, or a non-weakly imported Swift runtime symbol newer than the floor — a clean build says nothing about any of them, and dyld kills the app before `main` (Irisin 4.5.11 died on iOS 26.6.2 importing `_swift_initBorrow`, which swift-collections 1.7.0 built with Xcode 27 brings in). The runtime comparison needs an iOS 18.x simulator runtime installed (its Swift libraries are files; 26 and later keep them in a shared cache); without one only the listed symbols are checked. Its `note:` lines are weak imports the code must guard, not failures. A dependency bump that tracks the standard library closely is tested by launching the packaged Release build on a device below the newest iOS, not by building it.
- Packaging inputs are templates: `@PREFIX@` in `Packaging/wiki.qaq.inspectord.plist`, `DEBIAN/postinst`, `DEBIAN/prerm`, and `DEBIAN/postrm` is substituted at package time (empty for roothide, `/var/jb` for rootless), and `@FLAVOR@` in `DEBIAN/control`. The hooks manage the daemon only: each names its label once (`label=`) and boots out `system/`, `user/501/` and `gui/501/`, because roothide's launchctl can land the daemon in the per-user domain; `uikittools`' triggers register the app, so no hook calls `uicache`. Never hardcode an install prefix in Swift — the daemon derives its install root from `proc_pidpath`.
- **The app's data folder is `~/Documents/wiki.qaq.Inspector`, and the package
  makes it.** The app has no container, so its home is mobile's —
  `<jbroot>/var/mobile` on roothide, `/var/mobile` on rootless — shared with
  every other app without one. Anything it keeps there goes in a folder named
  for its bundle id, the isolation a container would give, inside a
  `Documents` mobile owns, which a container would have had too. The postinst
  (dpkg, as root) makes each missing level — home, `Documents`, the folder —
  and hands it to mobile on its own, leaves a level that exists alone, and
  never follows a symlink. Never `mkdir -p` as root: it leaves every level
  above the last one root's, and Irisin 4.3.4–4.5.25 left a roothide
  bootstrap's `Documents` root's that way, so no other app without a
  container could make anything there.
- `make harness` — run the shared data-layer and scene-restoration reset tests on macOS (fast; no device needed).
- Build settings live in `Configuration/*.xcconfig`, not in `project.pbxproj`. `Configuration/Version.xcconfig` is the single source of the app, daemon, CLI, and `.deb` version — change it with `make set-version VERSION=1.2.3 [BUILD=n]`; `make check` fails if a version is hardcoded back into the project file.
- Optional local overrides go in the git-ignored `Configuration/Developer*.xcconfig` files (for example `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`). See `Configuration/Developer.xcconfig.example`.
- CI builds, Release publishes what CI built. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (`name: CI`) runs on every push to `main`, every pull request and on dispatch: one job on the GitHub-hosted `macos-26` runner builds both packages, verifies them, and keeps `build/Packages/` for thirty days as the artifact `Inspector-<sha>`. It publishes nothing. `.github/workflows/release.yml` (`name: Release`) runs on a `vX.Y.Z` tag, compiles nothing, waits for that commit's CI run, refuses unless it succeeded, downloads its artifact, checks the sums, and publishes. So the commit says its version before the tag (`make set-version`, then `Documents/Releases/<version>.md`, then the tag) — a rebuild at tag time would be a different build number, a different runner image and bytes no check ever ran against. A commit that never reached `main` has no run: dispatch CI on the tag (`gh workflow run ci.yml --ref vX.Y.Z`) and re-run Release; that is also the way back once the artifact is past its thirty days. Keep the name `Release` — `pages.yml` watches `workflow_run: workflows: [Release]`, so a repo that publishes from `ci.yml` refreshes the depiction before the release exists.
- The published page lives in `Documents/Site/` (`index.html`, `icon.png`). `.github/workflows/pages.yml` deploys it, so the repo's Pages source must be **GitHub Actions**, not the legacy `/docs` folder. Keep those files at `Site/` root — `manifest.json` fetches `https://owngoal-dev.github.io/Inspector/icon.png`.
- The minimum OS is iOS 13 (`IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` in `Configuration/Base.xcconfig`; `make check` keeps the `.deb`'s `firmware` dependency in step). That floor is why the app is UIKit with a classic `UISplitViewController`, not SwiftUI, and what any new API has to be weighed against:
  - Gate anything newer than iOS 13 with `#available` and give the older path a real fallback (`InspectorMenuButton` shows a `UIMenu` from iOS 14 and action sheets on 13).
  - `String(localized:)` resolves to the shim in `Inspector/LocalizedText.swift`, not Foundation's. Xcode can't extract strings through it, so every entry in `Localizable.xcstrings` is `"extractionState": "manual"` — add new keys (and their translations) to the catalog by hand, with the exact format key (`%lld` for `Int`, `%d` for `Int32`, `%@` for `String`). Because nothing here is extracted, nothing should ever be reaped: `make check` runs `Scripts/check-stale-strings.py` and fails on a `stale` marker, which Xcode writes during a build and which would otherwise ride into a commit as one green line in a file of twelve thousand. `Scripts/prune-xcstrings.py` is the fix; it never deletes a key it cannot account for, because a key can be live and invisible here by design.
  - Swift concurrency only ships with the OS from iOS 15. The app embeds `libswift_Concurrency.dylib` in `Frameworks/`; `Scripts/package-deb.sh` signs it and installs a second copy at `usr/lib/inspector/` for the CLI, whose rpath looks there after `/usr/lib/swift`. The daemon must stay free of `async`/`await`.
- The simulator has no daemon: `InspectorClient/SimulatorProcessSource.swift` (simulator builds only) feeds the app made-up processes so the screens can be exercised from Xcode.
- `Inspector/main.swift` clears this app's saved scene state before `UIApplicationMain` on every cold launch, regardless of launch source. Keep this before UIKit startup so old SwiftUI sessions cannot bypass the UIKit scene delegate. Background resumes preserve their live scene; preferences are not cleared.
- `project.pbxproj` must keep `objectVersion = 77` so Xcode 16+ and the CI runner's Xcode can read it; newer Xcode betas rewrite it on GUI save, and `make check` fails when that happens — revert that line.
- SourceKit/editor diagnostics in this repo are frequently stale false positives (`PBXFileSystemSynchronizedRootGroup`); trust `xcodebuild` output, not the editor.

## Install on a device running custom firmware

Install the package produced by `make deb` with your preferred package manager — the `iphoneos-arm64e` build on roothide, the `iphoneos-arm64` build on rootless. The archive installs `Inspector.app`, `usr/bin/inspector`, `usr/libexec/inspectord`, and the on-demand LaunchDaemon plist, at the bootstrap root (roothide) or under `/var/jb` (rootless).

After install, validate with:

```sh
sudo /usr/bin/inspector self-test   # roothide; on rootless: /var/jb/usr/bin/inspector
uiopen -b wiki.qaq.Inspector             # launch the app
```

Clean up any temporary upload copies after install. Do not leave stray package files on the device.

## On-device inspection: our CLI only (enforced)

All process inspection and verification on the device MUST go through our own CLI — never spawn or fork system tools (`ps`, `pgrep`, `top`, etc.; most don't exist on the device anyway). Paths below are the roothide ones; on rootless prepend `/var/jb`:

- `sudo /usr/bin/inspector list` — pid / ppid / uid / threads / mem / name
- `sudo /usr/bin/inspector inspect <pid>` — full JSON for one process (all collectors, incl. `executablePath`)
- `sudo /usr/bin/inspector details <kind> <pid>`, `watch`, `signal`, `self-test`

Dogfooding the CLI is the point: if it can't answer a question about a process, that's a product gap to fix, not a reason to shell out.

## RootHide runtime dependency policy

Evaluate official `libroothide`/`libvroot` before adding a new bootstrap path
shim. This native app/daemon currently keeps a physical-path contract: process
identity, filesystem decisions and Foundation must refer to the same path.
Do not apply `symredirect` to only one side of that boundary. Packaging rejects
an accidental vroot dependency on the native daemon. Both package layouts may
reuse these native binaries; `libvroot` itself is RootHide-specific and is not
made rootless-compatible by changing the Debian architecture label.
References: `roothide/Developer`'s `vroot.md`, and `roothide/libroothide`'s
`init.c` and `stub.h`. `libroot` is a separate Rootless v2 path API.
