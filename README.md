# Inspector

Inspect running processes on an iPhone or iPad running custom firmware. Monitor CPU usage, memory, thread counts, and process owners in a live list, then open a process to inspect its threads, files, ports, and loaded modules.

## Install

Add the OwnGoal Studio repository in your preferred package manager:

**[apt.owngoal.dev](https://apt.owngoal.dev/)**

Packages are also on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/owngoal-dev/Inspector/releases). Choose the file that matches your bootstrap.

| Bootstrap | Package |
| --- | --- |
| [roothide](https://github.com/roothide) | `iphoneos-arm64e` |
| Rootless (`/var/jb`) | `iphoneos-arm64` |

Requires iOS 15 or later. Inspector is not for the App Store.

## Features

- **Live process list**: View CPU usage, memory, thread counts, and process owners with updates every second. Pause updates to inspect the current list.
- **Find a process**: Search by name or PID. Sort by CPU usage, memory, PID, or name. Filter to system, user, or app processes.
- **Process details**: Threads, open files and sockets, Mach ports, loaded modules, sandbox status, and disk and network use.
- **Stop a process**: Ask It to Quit or Force Quit from the detail screen. PID 1 cannot be stopped.
- **Export**: Share a snapshot of a process as a file.
- **Command line**: Inspect processes and monitor CPU usage from a terminal with `inspector`.

## Command Line

```sh
sudo inspector list
sudo inspector inspect 1
sudo inspector details 1 all
sudo inspector watch --count 10 --interval-ms 1000
sudo inspector self-test
```

`self-test` is read-only. Add `--signal` only when you want to exercise Ask It to Quit and Force Quit on a child of the CLI — it does not target a system process.

With a rootless bootstrap, the tool is `/var/jb/usr/bin/inspector`.

## Build from Source

Requires macOS with Xcode, `ldid`, and `dpkg-deb`.

```sh
make deb              # roothide
make deb FLAVOR=rootless
make deb-all          # both packages
make harness          # data-layer tests on Mac
```
